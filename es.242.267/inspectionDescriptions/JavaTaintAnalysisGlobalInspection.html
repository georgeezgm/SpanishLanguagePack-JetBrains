<p>The inspection is designed to identify potentially vulnerable sections of code where data
  obtained from potentially unreliable sources may be used in operations that pose security risks.</p>

<p>Data Flow Tracking:</p>

<p>The inspection tracks the flow of data from the source to its usage in critical operations.
  This includes analyzing the transfer of data through methods, objects, and variables.</p>

<p>Consider an example where user input is directly used in an SQL query without proper preprocessing.
  The inspection would issue a warning about a potential SQL injection.</p>
<pre>
String userInput = getUserInput();
String sqlQuery = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "'";
