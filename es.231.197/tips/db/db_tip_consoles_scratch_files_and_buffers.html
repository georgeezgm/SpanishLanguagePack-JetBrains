When you create a data source, a database console is created automatically. To open the console, right-click the data source and select <span class="control">Navigation | Jump to Query Console | Open Default Console</span>. To create a new console, right-click the data source and select <span class="control">New | Query Console</span>.</p><p><span class="control">Scratch files</span> are SQL files that are not attached to a data source. Refer to scratch files as temporary notes or drafts for some code ideas outside the project context. To create a scratch file, navigate to <span class="control">File | New | Scratch File</span> (or press <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:NewScratchFile;</span>).</p><p><span class="control">Scratch buffers</span> are simple text files without any coding assistance features. Scratch buffers can be used for simple task lists and notes to yourself. There is no dedicated menu item for the action to create a new scratch buffer, but you can use the <span class="control">Find Action</span> popup (<span class="shortcut">&shortcut:GotoAction;</span>) and run the <span class="control">New Scratch Buffer</span> action.</p><p class="image"><img src="images/tips_db_consoles_scratch_file_buffer.png" alt="Database consoles, scratch files and scratch buffers" style="border: 1px solid #55555;" /></p></body></html>
